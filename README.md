# BT-BurstBallisticAmmoChecker

In the vanilla game if you try and fire a machine gun (or other burst ballistic effect-based weapon) and you will shoot more times than you have bullets remaining in your ammo bin, the game can soft lock very easily. This patches the calculations involved so the soft lock is avoided.
